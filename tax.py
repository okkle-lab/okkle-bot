"""Vehicle-aware mileage maths (simplified-mileage method only).

Rates are HMRC simplified-expenses / approved mileage rates:
- Car or van: 55p per business mile for the first 10,000 miles, 25p thereafter
- Motorbike / moped: 24p per mile (flat)
- Bicycle / e-bike: 20p per mile (flat)

The 10,000-mile threshold is annual and cumulative, so it only bites when a
total is passed in (e.g. the running summary), not on a single weekly entry.
