"""Flow C — vehicle settings (and the wider settings menu).

A small text state machine. WhatsApp would render these option lists as buttons;
in the terminal the user replies with the option number (or a vehicle word).

State is stored on User.settings_state as "name" or "name:payload". The single
entry point is handle(): it returns True if it consumed the message (the user is
in the settings flow, opened it, or used a natural-language vehicle intent),
otherwise False so the normal router carries on.

Design rules from the spec:
- Buttons (numbers) drive every actual change; nothing is saved silently.
- Changing main/default affects future mileage only — confirmed records never change.
- Vehicles are tracked by *type*, not by named individual vehicles.
